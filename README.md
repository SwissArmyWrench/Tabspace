# Tabspace
A Mozilla Firefox add-on to create an Opera-like workspace functionality, allowing organization of tabs into workspaces.

Opera's browsers feature a powerful workspace system that allows the user to create individual groups of tabs. They can be switched between with keyboard shortcuts. This system is not present in the stock configuration of any other browser, but it is very useful. Tabspace creates this system within Mozilla Firefox to provide workspace capabilities in a polished and well presented way.

**This project is a work in progress, and at this moment in time is not ready for use.**
